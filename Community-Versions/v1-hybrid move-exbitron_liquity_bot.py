### Comment:
### I call this approach a hybrid move strategy. It resets orders based on two key conditions: either when the price changes by a defined percentage, or when a specific timer runs out.
###  I‚Äôve tested this logic using a backtest setup with a converted TradingView script. Adding the percentage-based price movement as a trigger helps the bot react more intelligently to sudden market swings ‚Äî especially during pump and dump situations.
### On the other hand, if the price range becomes too narrow and there‚Äôs not enough movement, the bot will go into a sleep state based on the timer, avoiding unnecessary actions in low-volatility conditions.
